	 *                          position stays grounded because they never gain the velocity to leave the ground

			 * - Removes Player_Block_InputPressed tag → enables new button presses
			 * - Removes Player_Block_InputReleased tag → processes button releases normally
			 * 
			 * Effect on gameplay:
			 * - Player controller no longer sees blocking tags and resumes processing input
			 * - Character can move, cast abilities, and interact with the world again
			 * - Returns full control to the player after stun duration expires
			 * 
			 * Tag counting safety:
			 * - If multiple stuns were applied, tags only fully remove when count reaches 0
			 * - This prevents premature input restoration if overlapping stuns exist
			 * - GAS automatically handles the reference counting for loose tags

	 * 
	 * Parameters explained:
	 * - InOwnerActor (FoxPlayerState): The actor that OWNS the Ability System Component
	 *   * For players, this is always the PlayerState because it persists across respawns
	 *   * The Owner is responsible for replication and ability state persistence
	 *   * PlayerState ownership ensures abilities/attributes survive character death
	 * 
	 * - InAvatarActor (this): The physical character that REPRESENTS the abilities visually
	 *   * 'this' refers to the AFoxCharacter instance calling this function
	 *   * The Avatar is the physical pawn/character in the world that executes abilities
	 *   * Visual effects, animations, and ability execution happen on the Avatar
	 *   * The Avatar can change (respawn, possess different character) while Owner stays the same
	 * 
	 * What InitAbilityActorInfo does internally:
	 * - Stores references to both Owner and Avatar actors
	 * - Initializes ability replication and networking based on Owner's network role
	 * - Prepares the ASC for ability activation, attribute changes, and gameplay effect application
	 * - MUST be called before using any GAS functionality (abilities, attributes, effects)
	 * 
	 * Multiplayer considerations:
	 * - Called on both Server (PossessedBy) and Client (OnRep_PlayerState)
	 * - Server: Sets up authoritative ability system with full replication rights
	 * - Client: Sets up local prediction and cosmetic ability execution
	 * - Owner actor determines replication authority (PlayerState is replicated actor)

	 * 2. Cast<UFoxAbilitySystemComponent>(...) - Performs a safe cast to our custom UFoxAbilitySystemComponent subclass
	 *    - Cast<> is Unreal's template function for runtime type casting

	 * - GetAbilitySystemComponent() returns the base UAbilitySystemComponent* type
	 * - AbilityActorInfoSet() is a custom function only available in UFoxAbilitySystemComponent
	 * - We must cast to the derived type to access our custom functionality
	 * 
	 * What AbilityActorInfoSet() does:
	 * - Broadcasts a delegate that notifies listeners that AbilityActorInfo has been initialized
	 * - UI widgets and other systems can bind to this delegate to know when GAS is ready
	 * - This allows UI elements to safely access ability data without nullptr crashes
	 * 
	 * Safety note:
	 * - No nullptr check here because we're certain this is a UFoxAbilitySystemComponent
	 * - The PlayerState is guaranteed to have the correct ASC type in our game architecture

	 * This delegate is crucial for components that need to interact with the Ability System Component

	 * 
	 * Example workflow with UDebuffNiagaraComponent:
	 * 1. DebuffNiagaraComponent is created and BeginPlay() is called
	 * 2. At that time, the character might not have its ASC initialized yet
	 * 3. DebuffNiagaraComponent checks if ASC exists. If not, it binds to OnAscRegistered delegate
	 * 4. When this broadcast fires, the lambda in DebuffNiagaraComponent executes
	 * 5. The component can now safely register for gameplay tag events (e.g., debuff application/removal)
	 * 6. This enables the visual effect to activate/deactivate based on debuff tag count changes
	 * 
	 * Without this delegate:
	 * - Components would need polling or complex timing logic to know when ASC is ready
	 * - Race conditions could occur where components try to access an uninitialized ASC
	 * - Gameplay tag event registration would fail, breaking debuff visual feedback
	 *

	 * 2. FFoxGameplayTags::Get().Debuff_Stun - The gameplay tag we're monitoring (represents stun debuff state)
	 * 3. EGameplayTagEventType::NewOrRemoved - Event type that triggers when:
	 *    - NewOrRemoved: Fires when tag count goes from 0 to 1 (added) OR from 1 to 0 (removed)
	 *    - Alternative types: NewOrIncremented (fires on every add), RemovedOrDecremented (fires on every remove)
	 * 4. .AddUObject(this, &AFoxCharacter::StunTagChanged) - Binds the StunTagChanged function as the callback

	 * - When a stun effect is applied (tag added), StunTagChanged fires with NewCount > 0 (NewCount is an input parameter
	 *   of the callback function that the delegate will pass this function. It is the the new tag count)
	 * - When all stun effects expire (tag removed), StunTagChanged fires with NewCount = 0
	 * - StunTagChanged then applies/removes input blocking tags and stun visual effects
	 * 
	 * Note: The callback function StunTagChanged receives:
	 * - CallbackTag: The tag that changed (Debuff_Stun in this case)
	 * - NewCount: The new reference count for this tag (0 = removed, >0 = active)
