	 * Configure the enemy's skeletal mesh to block the Visibility collision channel, which is essential for cursor-based
	 * interaction and targeting systems.
	 * 
	 * What is ECC_Visibility?
	 * - ECC_Visibility is a trace channel specifically designed for line traces that determine what objects are "visible"
	 *   or interactable from the player's perspective
	 * - It's commonly used for cursor traces (like clicking on objects), camera visibility checks, and targeting systems
	 * - By default, many objects ignore this channel, so we must explicitly configure responses for interactive objects
	 * 
	 * What does ECR_Block mean?
	 * - ECR_Block (Collision Response: Block) means this mesh will stop/block traces on the Visibility channel
	 * - When a line trace on the Visibility channel hits this mesh, it will register a hit and stop the trace
	 * - This is different from ECR_Overlap (trace passes through but registers hit) or ECR_Ignore (trace passes through
	 *   completely)
	 * 
	 * Why is this important for enemies?
	 * - This allows the player's cursor to "hit" and select the enemy when hovering over it in the game world
	 * - Essential for click-to-target systems, allowing players to select enemies for attack or interaction
	 * - Works in conjunction with the HighlightActor() system - when the cursor trace hits this mesh, we can trigger
	 *   the custom depth highlighting to visually indicate the enemy is targetable
	 * - Without this setting, cursor traces would pass through the enemy and fail to detect it as an interactive target
	 * 
	 * How it works with our highlight system:
	 * 1. Player moves cursor over enemy in viewport
	 * 2. Game performs a line trace on the ECC_Visibility channel from cursor into world
	 * 3. Trace hits this enemy's mesh because we set collision response to Block
	 * 4. Hit result triggers HighlightActor() which enables custom depth rendering
	 * 5. Post-process material draws red outline around enemy mesh and weapon
	 * 6. When cursor moves away, UnHighlightActor() is called to remove the effect

	   associated BlackboardAsset that defines what keys/variables are available. 

	   We dereference (*) the BehaviorTree->BlackboardAsset pointer to pass the actual UBlackboardData object to 
	   InitializeBlackboard(). The BlackboardAsset is a data asset that you create in the Unreal Editor (usually 
	   named something like BB_EnemyName). Inside this asset, you define all the keys (variables) that the AI will 
	   use - for example, you might define a key called "TargetActor" of type Object, "PatrolLocation" of type Vector, 
	   or "IsChasing" of type Bool. 

	   When InitializeBlackboard() is called, it reads through all the key definitions in the BlackboardAsset and 
	   creates actual storage space in the Blackboard Component for each one. It allocates memory for each key based 
	   on its type and sets them to their default values. After this initialization, the Blackboard Component now has 
	   all these keys available as empty slots ready to store data. The Behavior Tree's tasks can then write values 
	   to these keys (like setting "TargetActor" to the player character) and read from them (like checking if

	/*
	 * Custom Depth Rendering and Stencil System for Actor Highlighting
	 * 
	 * What is Custom Depth?
	 * - Custom Depth is a special rendering pass in Unreal Engine that renders objects to a separate buffer
	 * - This buffer (called the Custom Depth buffer) can be accessed in post-process materials to create effects
	 * - When enabled on a mesh, that mesh is rendered into this separate depth buffer independently of the main scene
	 * - Think of it like a "mask" or "selection layer" in Photoshop - it marks which pixels belong to this object
	 * 
	 * What is the Stencil Value?
	 * - The Custom Depth Stencil is an 8-bit integer value (0-255) you can assign to each mesh
	 * - This value is stored per-pixel in the Custom Depth buffer alongside the depth information
	 * - Different objects can have different stencil values to identify or color them differently
	 * - In our case: CUSTOM_DEPTH_RED is a macro (defined in Fox.h) representing a specific integer value
	 * - This value tells our post-process material to render this object with a red highlight color
	 * 
	 * How Does the Highlighting Work?
	 * 1. We enable Custom Depth rendering on the mesh (tells engine to render it to Custom Depth buffer)
	 * 2. We assign a stencil value (CUSTOM_DEPTH_RED) that identifies this as a "red highlight" object
	 * 3. A Post-Process Material (set up in the project) reads the Custom Depth buffer every frame
	 * 4. The post-process material checks each pixel's stencil value
	 * 5. If it finds our CUSTOM_DEPTH_RED value, it draws a red outline/glow effect around that object
	 * 6. This happens after all normal rendering, as a screen-space effect overlaid on the final image
	 * 
	 * Why Both Mesh and Weapon?
	 * - The character's body (GetMesh) and weapon are separate mesh components
	 * - We want the entire enemy (body + weapon) to highlight when targeted
	 * - So we enable custom depth and set the same stencil value on both components
	 * - This ensures a unified highlight effect across the complete character
	 * 
	 * Common Use Cases:
	 * - Highlighting interactable objects when the player looks at them
	 * - Showing enemy outlines through walls (wallhack effect)
	 * - Team-colored outlines in multiplayer games
	 * - Selection indicators in strategy games
