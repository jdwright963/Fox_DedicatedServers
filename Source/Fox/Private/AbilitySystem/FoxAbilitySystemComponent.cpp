					 * the event data. This enables abilities to implement complex input-responsive behaviors like:
					 * 
					 * - Charging mechanics: A fireball ability could start charging when first activated, then release when input is
					 *   pressed again while the ability is still running (detected by this InputPressed event).
					 * - Combo systems: A melee attack ability could chain into different attacks based on timing additional input presses
					 *   during the attack animation (each press triggers this event, which the ability blueprint can respond to).
					 * - Hold-to-channel abilities: A healing ability could begin channeling on activation, then cancel or change behavior
					 *   when the player presses the input again (signaled by this event) while still channeling.
					 * - Multi-stage abilities: A teleport ability could mark a location on first activation, then teleport to that location
					 *   when the player presses the input a second time (the second press triggers this InputPressed event).
					 * 
					 * Without this event system, abilities could only respond to their initial activation. They would have no way to detect
					 * additional input presses while still running, severely limiting design possibilities. This event notification system
					 * transforms abilities from simple "fire-and-forget" actions into dynamic, interactive systems that can respond to
					 * player input throughout their entire execution lifecycle, enabling sophisticated ability designs commonly seen in
					 * action RPGs and MOBAs.

					 * listeners that pause execution until they receive their matching event tag, then continue the blueprint graph with
					 * the event data. This enables abilities to implement complex input-responsive behaviors like:
					 * 
					 * - Charging mechanics: A fireball ability could start charging when first activated, then release when input is
					 *   released again while the ability is still running (detected by this InputReleased event).
					 * - Combo systems: A melee attack ability could chain into different attacks based on timing additional input presses
					 *   during the attack animation (each press triggers this event, which the ability blueprint can respond to).
					 * - Hold-to-channel abilities: A healing ability could begin channeling on activation, then cancel or change behavior
					 *   when the player presses the input again (signaled by this event) while still channeling.
					 * - Multi-stage abilities: A teleport ability could mark a location on first activation, then teleport to that location
					 *   when the player presses the input a second time (the second press triggers this InputReleased event).
					 * 
					 * Without this event system, abilities could only respond to their initial activation. They would have no way to detect
					 * additional input presses while still running, severely limiting design possibilities. This event notification system
					 * transforms abilities from simple "fire-and-forget" actions into dynamic, interactive systems that can respond to
					 * player input throughout their entire execution lifecycle, enabling sophisticated ability designs commonly seen in
					 * action RPGs and MOBAs.

	 * This notifies all systems that have registered callbacks with this delegate (typically UI widgets like
	 * overlay controllers) that a gameplay effect has been applied with these specific asset tags.
	 * Listeners can use these tags to trigger visual effects, display messages, update health bars, or perform
	 * any other logic that needs to respond to effects being applied to this character.
	 * Broadcast() calls all bound functions synchronously in the order they were registered, passing the TagContainer
	 * by const reference to each callback for efficient read-only access to the effect's identifying tags.
