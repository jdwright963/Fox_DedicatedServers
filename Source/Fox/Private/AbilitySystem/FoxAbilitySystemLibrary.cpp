	 * Why static_cast vs C-style cast (e.g., (int32)XPReward):
	 * - C-style casts are inherited from C and work in both C and C++, using syntax like (TargetType)value
	 * - static_cast is a modern C++ casting operator (introduced in C++98) that provides compile-time type checking
	 * - static_cast is more explicit about the programmer's intent, making code more readable and maintainable
	 * - static_cast is searchable in code (can find "static_cast" but harder to search for all C-style casts)
	 * - static_cast will produce compiler errors if the conversion is not allowed, catching bugs earlier
	 * - C-style casts can perform dangerous conversions (like casting away const) without warning
