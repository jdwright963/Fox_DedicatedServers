/**
 * Static helper struct that manages attribute capture definitions for the damage calculation system.
 * 
 * This struct serves as a centralized registry of all attributes that need to be captured during damage
 * calculations in UExecCalc_Damage.
 * The struct captures both secondary attributes (Armor, BlockChance, CriticalHit stats, ArmorPenetration) and
 * resistance attributes (Fire, Lightning, Arcane, Physical) from either the Source (attacker) or Target (defender)
 * of a gameplay effect, allowing the damage calculation to read and use these values when computing final damage.
 */
struct FoxDamageStatics
{
	/*
	* DECLARE_ATTRIBUTE_CAPTUREDEF is an Unreal Engine macro that creates two member variables for attribute capture:
	* 
	* 1. ArmorProperty - An FProperty pointer that references the Armor attribute's reflection metadata in UFoxAttributeSet.
	*    
	*    "Reflection metadata" refers to the runtime type information that Unreal's reflection system generates
	*    and stores for any UPROPERTY-marked variable. This metadata allows the engine to
	*    find and access variables by name at runtime (even on unknown object instances)
	*    
	*    The ArmorProperty pointer specifically points to the reflection metadata for the "Armor" float variable
	*    inside UFoxAttributeSet. This pointer acts as a "blueprint" or "map" that tells the damage calculation
	*    system exactly where and how to find the Armor value on any character's attribute set instance, even
	*    though we don't know which specific character object we'll be reading from at compile time.
	*    
	*    This is essential for the attribute capture system because it needs to dynamically read attribute values
	*    from different characters (source attacker and target defender) during gameplay effect execution, without
	*    hardcoding specific object references or using brittle string-based lookups.
	* 
	* 2. ArmorDef - An FGameplayEffectAttributeCaptureDefinition that specifies how to capture the attribute (from Source/Target, snapshot vs live)
	* 
	* These declarations enable the damage calculation system to read attribute values from characters during gameplay
	* effect execution. The actual initialization of these variables happens in the FoxDamageStatics constructor below
	* using DEFINE_ATTRIBUTE_CAPTUREDEF.
	* 
	* The following DECLARE_ATTRIBUTE_CAPTUREDEF lines create similar pairs of variables for other attributes used in
	* damage calculations (e.g., BlockChanceProperty/BlockChanceDef, ArmorPenetrationProperty/ArmorPenetrationDef, etc.)

		  DEFINE_ATTRIBUTE_CAPTUREDEF is an Unreal Engine macro that performs two critical initializations
		  to set up attribute capture for gameplay effect calculations:
		
		  1. Initializes ArmorProperty (an FProperty pointer):
			 - Uses Unreal's reflection system via FindFieldChecked to search UFoxAttributeSet's class definition
			 - Locates the UPROPERTY-marked float variable named "Armor" within the attribute set class
			 - Stores a pointer to that property's reflection information (FProperty*)
			 - This pointer acts as a "blueprint" that tells the system where to find and how to read the Armor
			   value from any UFoxAttributeSet instance at runtime, without needing to know the specific object
			 - The "Checked" suffix means the engine crashes immediately at startup if the property isn't found,
			   providing early detection of typos or missing attributes during development
		
		  2. Initializes ArmorDef (an FGameplayEffectAttributeCaptureDefinition):
			 - Wraps the ArmorProperty pointer with additional capture configuration
			 - Specifies FROM WHERE to capture: Target (the defender receiving the effect, not the Source attacker)
			 - Specifies WHEN to capture: false = live value (read current value during execution, not a snapshot
			   taken when the effect was created)
			 - This capture definition can then be registered with the execution calculation's
			   RelevantAttributesToCapture array and used with AttemptCalculateCapturedAttributeMagnitude to
			   retrieve the actual attribute value during damage calculations
		
		  Macro Parameters:
		  - UFoxAttributeSet: The attribute set class that contains the attribute to capture
		  - Armor: The name of the attribute variable to capture (must match UPROPERTY name exactly)
		  - Target: Specifies to capture from the effect's Target (could also be Source for attacker attributes)
		  - false: Don't snapshot - capture the live/current value during execution (true would snapshot at creation)

	Ability System which attributes this execution calculation needs to read from characters during damage calculations.

	This array must be populated in the constructor (before any Execute_Implementation calls occur) so the GAS can:
	1. Pre-allocate memory and set up capture infrastructure for the specified attributes
	2. Validate that all requested attributes exist and are accessible on the target attribute sets
	3. Enable the AttemptCalculateCapturedAttributeMagnitude() function to successfully retrieve attribute values
	   during Execute_Implementation by looking up the registered capture definitions

	Each FGameplayEffectAttributeCaptureDefinition stored in this array contains:
	- A pointer to the attribute set that contains the attribute (e.g., UFoxAttributeSet)
	- An FProperty pointer identifying which attribute to capture (e.g., ArmorProperty points to the Armor float in UFoxAttributeSet)
	- A source specification (EGameplayEffectAttributeCaptureSource: Source attacker or Target defender)
	- A snapshot flag (bool: capture value at effect creation time vs live value during execution)

	Without registering capture definitions here, AttemptCalculateCapturedAttributeMagnitude() calls in Execute_Implementation
	would fail silently and return default values (usually 0.f), causing incorrect damage calculations.

	The following Add() calls register all attributes needed for this damage calculation system:
	- Secondary attributes: Armor, BlockChance, ArmorPenetration, CriticalHitChance, CriticalHitResistance, CriticalHitDamage
	- Resistance attributes: FireResistance, LightningResistance, ArcaneResistance, PhysicalResistance

	Each definition was initialized in the FoxDamageStatics constructor using DEFINE_ATTRIBUTE_CAPTUREDEF and is

		How SetByCaller works:
		1. When an ability creates a gameplay effect spec, it can call SetSetByCallerMagnitude() with a tag and value
		2. The tag acts as a unique key (in this case, a damage type tag like Damage.Fire)
		3. The value is the amount of damage for that type (e.g., 50.0 for 50 fire damage)
		4. Multiple SetByCaller values can be set on the same spec with different tags
		5. Here we retrieve that stored value using GetSetByCallerMagnitude() with the damage type tag as the key

		Example: An ability could set Damage.Fire = 50.0 and Damage.Lightning = 25.0 on the spec,
		and this code would retrieve and accumulate both values across loop iterations.
		
		We pass the `Pair.Key` to `GetSetByCallerMagnitude()` to retrieve the damage value for this specific type.
		`Pair.Value` is the attribute tag that will be used to apply resistance to this damage type.
		
		We set the WarnIfNotFound parameter to false to avoid logging warnings when a damage type is not found, since we
		check each damage type and not every attack has each damage type. So it is a normal situation and we don't want to
		pollute the logs with unnecessary warnings.

		  * The method evaluates all such modifiers that match the current tags, aggregates them with the base attribute value,
		    and computes the final effective magnitude that should be used in this calculation
		  * This allows attributes to be dynamically modified based on active buffs, debuffs, or situational gameplay states

			Calls Unreal's built-in radial damage system that uses physics traces to find all actors within a spherical radius,
			calculates distance-based damage falloff for each hit actor, and broadcasts damage events through their damage
			handling interfaces.

			Parameters:
			- WorldContextObject (TargetAvatar): The UObject that provides the world context for the damage trace, determining which
			  UWorld instance to perform the radial damage query in. We use TargetAvatar as a convenience since we already have it
			  available and any actor in the world provides valid world context.
			  
			- BaseDamage (DamageTypeValue): The maximum damage dealt at the inner radius. Actors exactly at or within the inner
			  radius receive this full damage amount before any other modifiers are applied.
			  
			- MinimumDamage (0.f): The minimum damage dealt at the outer radius. Actors at the outer radius boundary receive this
			  damage amount. We set this to 0 to ensure actors at maximum range take no damage, creating a clear damage cutoff.
			  
			- Origin (GetRadialDamageOrigin): The world-space 3D point (FVector) that serves as the center of the damage sphere.
			  All distance calculations radiate outward from this point to determine falloff for each hit actor.
			  
			- DamageInnerRadius (GetRadialDamageInnerRadius): The radius in Unreal units within which actors receive full BaseDamage
			  with no falloff. Actors closer than this distance to the origin take maximum damage.
			  
			- DamageOuterRadius (GetRadialDamageOuterRadius): The maximum radius in Unreal units at which damage can be dealt.
			  Actors beyond this distance take no damage. Damage falls off linearly between inner and outer radius.
			  
			- DamageFalloff (1.f): The exponent that controls the falloff curve shape. 1.0 creates linear falloff, values greater
			  than 1.0 create exponential falloff (damage drops faster near outer radius), values less than 1.0 create logarithmic
			  falloff (damage drops slower). We use 1.0 for simple linear interpolation between min and max damage.
			  
			- DamageTypeClass (UDamageType::StaticClass()): The class type that categorizes this damage for gameplay systems.
			  We use the base UDamageType since we handle damage type categorization through our own gameplay tag system rather
			  than Unreal's damage type class hierarchy.
			  
			- IgnoreActors (TArray<AActor*>()): An array of actor pointers to exclude from the damage trace. We pass an empty
			  array since we want to damage all valid actors in the radius without exceptions.
			  
			- DamageCauser (SourceAvatar): The actor responsible for causing the damage, typically the attacker or projectile.
			  This is used for gameplay logic, AI threat systems, and damage attribution. We pass the source avatar since they
			  are the originator of this damage effect.
			  
			- InstigatorController (nullptr): The controller (player or AI) that initiated the damage event. We pass nullptr
			  because we don't need controller-level attribution for our damage system and the DamageCauser already provides
			  sufficient information for gameplay purposes.

			   ApplyRadialDamageWithFalloff routes damage through Unreal's damage system, which calls TakeDamage() on affected actors.
			   For AFoxCharacterBase targets, our TakeDamage() override broadcasts OnDamageDelegate with the final damage amount after
			   Unreal's radial falloff calculation. The lambda bound above captures that broadcast for TargetAvatar and updates
			   DamageTypeValue to the distance-adjusted damage amount.
