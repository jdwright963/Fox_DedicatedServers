/**
 * The AFoxProjectile class is a subclass of AActor designed to represent a projectile in the game world.
 * It uses a sphere component to detect overlaps with other objects, which can be utilized for collision logic,
 * such as applying damage or triggering effects upon impact.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Utilizes a USphereComponent for overlap detection.
 * - Implements the OnSphereOverlap function to handle collision events.
