	 * Client RPC that notifies the client about an ability status change that occurred on the server.
	 * UFUNCTION(Client, Reliable) ensures this function executes on the client when called from the server.
	 * "Reliable" guarantees the RPC will arrive even under poor network conditions.
	 * This function is called by the server after UpdateAbilityStatuses() determines that an ability's status
	 * has changed (e.g., from locked to eligible). The client then broadcasts the AbilityStatusChanged delegate
	 * to update local UI and systems with the new ability status.
	 * 
	 * Why we need a Client RPC here:
	 * The ability status changes (calculated in UpdateAbilityStatuses) occur on the server and need to be
	 * communicated to clients for UI updates. While ability specs themselves are replicated via OnRep_ActivateAbilities,
	 * the status tags within those specs are not automatically replicated in a way that triggers our delegate system.
	 * Without this RPC, clients wouldn't know when to update their UI elements (like spell menu widgets) to reflect
	 * newly unlocked or status-changed abilities. The RPC allows the server to explicitly notify clients to broadcast
	 * the AbilityStatusChanged delegate, which UI systems (like SpellMenuWidgetController) are listening to via
	 * BindCallbacksToDependencies(). This ensures the UI stays synchronized with the server's authoritative ability
	 * state changes without relying on polling or manual replication property notifications.
