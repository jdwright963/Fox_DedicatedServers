/**
 * Character Class Enumeration
 * 
 * This is a SCOPED ENUM (also called an "enum class") that defines the different character classes in the game.
 * 
 * What is a Scoped Enum (enum class)?
 * - A scoped enum is a type-safe enumeration introduced in C++11 that uses the 'class' keyword
 * - The 'class' keyword here does NOT mean it's a class - it creates a scoped enumeration type
 * - Scoped enums prevent name collisions by requiring the enum name as a prefix (e.g., ECharacterClass::Warrior)
 * - Values cannot be implicitly converted to integers, providing better type safety
 * - Contrast with unscoped enums (enum without 'class') where values are in the enclosing scope
 * 
 * UENUM(BlueprintType):
 * - UENUM is an Unreal macro that registers this enum with Unreal's reflection system
 * - BlueprintType specifier makes this enum accessible in Blueprints
 * 
 * : uint8 (Underlying Type):
 * - Specifies the underlying integer type used to store enum values
 * - uint8 is an unsigned 8-bit integer (0-255), taking only 1 byte of memory
 * - This is memory-efficient since we only have 3 character classes
 * - Without explicit specification, C++ defaults to 'int' (typically 4 bytes)
 * - Unreal recommends uint8 for UENUM types for memory efficiency and Blueprint compatibility
 * 
 * Enum Values:
 * - Elementalist = 0 (implicitly)
 * - Warrior = 1 (implicitly)
 * - Ranger = 2 (implicitly)

};

/**
 * Character Class Default Information Structure
 * 
 * This struct contains the default configuration data for each character class.
 * It is used to store class-specific gameplay effects and attributes that differ
 * between character classes (Elementalist, Warrior, Ranger).
 * 
 * USTRUCT(BlueprintType):
 * - USTRUCT is an Unreal macro that registers this struct with Unreal's reflection system
 * - BlueprintType makes this struct usable in Blueprints for visual scripting
 * 
 * GENERATED_BODY():
 * - Required Unreal macro that generates necessary boilerplate code for the struct
 * - Provides reflection data, serialization support, and other Unreal features
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - Instances of this struct are stored in the CharacterClassInformation TMap
 * - Each ECharacterClass enum value maps to one FCharacterClassDefaultInfo instance
 * - This allows different classes to have different primary attributes while sharing
 *   common attributes (secondary, vital) defined directly in UCharacterClassInfo
