	/**
	 * Applies damage to a target actor using the configured DamageEffectClass and DamageTypes.
	 * 
	 * UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable) exposes this C++ function to Blueprints as a callable node.
	 * 
	 * When called in Blueprint, this function generates TWO input pins:
	 * 
	 * 1. "Target" pin (implicit, execution pin context):
	 *    - Type: UFoxDamageGameplayAbility reference
	 *    - Default value: Self
	 *    - This represents the OBJECT instance on which this function is being called
	 *    - Since this is a non-static member function, it requires an instance of UFoxDamageGameplayAbility to execute
	 *    - In Blueprint, this is the "self" reference - the ability instance that owns and executes this function
	 *    - This pin provides access to all member variables (DamageEffectClass, DamageTypes) and inherited 
	 *      ability context (ability level, owner's ASC, etc.)
	 * 
	 * 2. "Target Actor" pin (explicit parameter):
	 *    - Type: AActor* (Actor Object Reference)
	 *    - This is the explicit function parameter defined in the C++ signature
	 *    - Represents the actor that will RECEIVE the damage
	 *    - Must be connected to an actor reference in Blueprint (e.g., from a collision hit result, target selection, etc.)
	 *    - The function retrieves this actor's Ability System Component and applies the damage effect to it
	 * 
	 * The distinction is crucial:
	 * - "Target" (self) = The ability instance doing the damage (source/instigator)
	 * - "TargetActor" = The actor receiving the damage (recipient/victim)
	 * 
	 * @param TargetActor The actor to receive damage. Must have an Ability System Component to receive gameplay effects.

	/**
	 * Constructs a FDamageEffectParams struct populated with values from this ability's
	 * EditDefaultsOnly properties (DamageEffectClass, DamageType, Damage, debuff settings, etc.).
	 * This factory function centralizes the creation of damage parameters, ensuring consistent
	 * initialization and reducing code duplication across different damage application scenarios.
	 * 
	 * The returned struct contains all necessary information to apply a damage effect including:
	 * - The gameplay effect class to instantiate (DamageEffectClass)
	 * - Source ability system component (from GetAbilitySystemComponentFromActorInfo())
	 * - Damage type tag and magnitude (evaluated at current ability level via Damage.GetValueAtLevel())
	 * - Debuff parameters (chance, damage, frequency, duration)
	 * - Radial damage parameters (inner/outer radius, origin point)
	 * - Knockback parameters (force magnitude, chance, optional direction override)
	 * - Death impulse magnitude and optional direction override
	 * - Optional pitch override for projectile abilities
	 * - Optional target actor for additional context
	 * 
	 * This method is const-qualified because it only reads member variables without modifying
	 * the ability's state. It can be called safely from other const methods or contexts where
	 * the ability instance should not be modified.
	 * 
	 * @param TargetActor Optional actor reference to include in the damage parameters. Defaults to nullptr
	 *                    if not provided. This can be used by damage execution calculations or attribute
	 *                    capture to query target-specific information (level, resistances, etc.).
	 * @param InRadialDamageOrigin World-space origin point for radial damage calculations. Defaults to FVector::ZeroVector.
	 *                             When bIsRadialDamage is true, this function uses this input parameter to override the value of 
	 *                             the RadialDamageOrigin member variable, 
	 *                             allowing dynamic specification of the damage epicenter (e.g., projectile
	 *                             impact location, spell ground target). When bIsRadialDamage is false, this parameter
	 *                             is ignored and has no effect on damage application.
	 * @param bOverrideKnockbackDirection When true, uses KnockbackDirectionOverride instead of calculating knockback
	 *                                    direction from source-to-target vector. Useful for abilities with specific
	 *                                    knockback directions (e.g., upward launches, directional pushes). Defaults to false.
	 * @param KnockbackDirectionOverride Custom normalized direction vector for knockback force when bOverrideKnockbackDirection
	 *                                   is true. Should be a unit vector. Ignored when bOverrideKnockbackDirection is false.
	 *                                   Defaults to FVector::ZeroVector.
	 * @param bOverrideDeathImpulse When true, uses DeathImpulseDirectionOverride instead of calculating death impulse
	 *                              direction from source-to-target vector. Allows custom ragdoll launch directions on death.
	 *                              Defaults to false.
	 * @param DeathImpulseDirectionOverride Custom normalized direction vector for death impulse when bOverrideDeathImpulse
	 *                                      is true. Should be a unit vector. Ignored when bOverrideDeathImpulse is false.
	 *                                      Defaults to FVector::ZeroVector.
	 * @param bOverridePitch When true, uses PitchOverride instead of the default pitch calculation for projectile-based
	 *                       abilities. Useful for abilities that need specific launch angles regardless of target position.
	 *                       Defaults to false.
	 * @param PitchOverride Custom pitch angle (in degrees) for projectile launch when bOverridePitch is true. Typical range
	 *                      is -90 to 90 degrees. Ignored when bOverridePitch is false. Defaults to 0.f.
	 * @return FDamageEffectParams struct containing all damage configuration from this ability's defaults,
	 *         ready to be used with UFoxAbilitySystemLibrary::ApplyDamageEffect() or similar functions.
	 *         
	 * This function is exposed to Blueprint as BlueprintPure because it only reads data and does not modify it
