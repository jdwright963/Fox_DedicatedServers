	/**
	 * AddToXP - Adds experience points to the player character
	 * 
	 * WHY THIS INTERFACE EXISTS:
	 * - AFoxPlayerState owns UFoxAttributeSet (PlayerState needs to include AttributeSet.h)
	 * - UFoxAttributeSet needs to talk to AFoxPlayerState when XP changes (AttributeSet would need to include PlayerState.h)
	 * - This creates a circular include/dependency: PlayerState includes AttributeSet, AttributeSet includes
	 *   PlayerState, and this repeats
	 * - Circular dependencies will cause compilation errors because the compiler cannot determine which header to process
	 *   first, resulting in incomplete type definitions and "undefined type" errors when trying to use class members.
	 * 
	 * The Fix:
	 * 1. Enemy dies, gives XP
	 * 2. UFoxAttributeSet detects XP change
	 * 3. AttributeSet calls AddToXP() on the character (as IPlayerInterface)
	 * 4. AFoxCharacter::AddToXP_Implementation() overrides this function
	 * 5. inside this function AFoxCharacter gets its PlayerState and calls PlayerState->AddToXP() which is its own 
	 *    AddToXP() function
	 * 6. AFoxPlayerState does the actual work (add XP, check for level up, etc.)
	 * 
	 * AFoxCharacter is the middleman - it overrides this function but just passes the work to PlayerState.
	 * No circular include: PlayerState -> AttributeSet -> Interface
	 * 
	 * BLUEPRINTNATIVEEVENT:
	 * 
	 * This is a BlueprintNativeEvent:
	 * - You override it in C++ by writing AddToXP_Implementation()
	 * - You can also override it in Blueprint
	 * - Blueprint overrides replace the C++ version
	 * 
	 * @param InXP How much XP to add
