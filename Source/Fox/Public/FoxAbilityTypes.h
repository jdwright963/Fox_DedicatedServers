/**
 * Parameter container struct for configuring and applying damage gameplay effects.
 * 
 * This struct encapsulates all necessary data required to create, configure, and apply
 * a damage gameplay effect from a source actor to a target actor. It is primarily used
 * by UFoxDamageGameplayAbility and its subclasses to pass damage parameters to gameplay
 * effect application functions.
 * 
 * KEY PURPOSES:
 * 1. Damage Configuration: Holds base damage amount, damage type tag, and ability level
 *    for calculating final damage values using scalable floats and modifiers.
 * 
 * 2. Debuff Parameters: Contains complete debuff configuration (chance, damage, duration,
 *    frequency) that is passed to the damage gameplay effect via SetByCaller magnitudes.
 * 
 * 3. Context Provision: Stores both source and target ability system components along with
 *    world context, providing all necessary references for gameplay effect spec creation
 *    and application.
 * 
 * 4. Effect Class Reference: Holds the gameplay effect class to instantiate, allowing
 *    different abilities to use different damage effect configurations while sharing
 *    the same application logic.
 * 
 * This design pattern separates damage configuration data from damage application logic,
 * making the system more maintainable, testable, and allowing easy addition of new damage
 * parameters without modifying function signatures.

	/**
	 * Shared pointer to a gameplay tag that identifies the type of damage dealt (e.g., Fire, Lightning, Physical).
	 * 
	 * WHAT IS TSharedPtr?
	 * TSharedPtr is Unreal Engine's implementation of a reference-counted smart pointer, similar to std::shared_ptr
	 * in standard C++. It automatically manages the lifetime of the object it points to by keeping track of how
	 * many TSharedPtr instances reference the same object. When the last TSharedPtr referencing an object is
	 * destroyed, the object is automatically deleted. This prevents memory leaks and dangling pointers.
	 * 
	 * Key characteristics of TSharedPtr:
	 * - Multiple TSharedPtr instances can share ownership of the same object
	 * - Thread-safe reference counting (atomic operations)
	 * - Automatic memory management (no manual delete required)
	 * - Can be null-checked with IsValid()
	 * - Supports dereferencing with * and -> operators
	 * 
	 * WHY NO UPROPERTY MACRO?
	 * TSharedPtr cannot be marked with UPROPERTY because Unreal's reflection system (UPROPERTY) is designed
	 * to work with UObject-based pointers and primitive types that can be directly serialized. TSharedPtr
	 * uses custom memory management and reference counting that is incompatible with Unreal's property system.
	 * 
	 * Instead, we handle serialization manually in the NetSerialize() function. When saving, we check if
	 * DamageType.IsValid() and set a bit in RepBits. When loading, we allocate a new FGameplayTag if needed
	 * and call NetSerialize on the pointed-to object. This gives us fine-grained control over network
	 * replication while still benefiting from shared pointer semantics for memory management.
	 * 
	 * WHY USE TSharedPtr FOR DAMAGE TYPE?
	 * We use TSharedPtr because the same FGameplayTag object may be shared across multiple FFoxGameplayEffectContext
	 * instances and we want to avoid unnecessary copies while ensuring the tag remains valid for the lifetime of
	 * all contexts that reference it.
	 * 
	 * CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF MULTIPLE CONTEXTS:
	 * 
	 * 1. Area of Effect Abilities:
	 *    When a fireball explodes and hits 5 enemies, the ability creates 5 separate FFoxGameplayEffectContext
	 *    instances (one per target). All 5 contexts can share the same "Damage.Fire" tag via TSharedPtr rather
	 *    than allocating 5 separate FGameplayTag objects. This saves memory and improves performance.
	 * 
	 * 2. Replicated Gameplay Effects:
	 *    When a damage effect is applied on the server and replicated to multiple clients, each machine creates
	 *    its own FFoxGameplayEffectContext via NetSerialize(). The original context on the server, the replicated
	 *    context on each client, and any duplicates created during execution can all share the same DamageType
	 *    tag through shared ownership, avoiding redundant allocations.
	 * 
	 * 3. Effect Duplication:
	 *    When FFoxGameplayEffectContext::Duplicate() is called to create a modified copy of a context (common
	 *    during gameplay effect execution), the duplicated context shares the same DamageType tag with the
	 *    original. This is both memory-efficient and semantically correct since the damage type doesn't change
	 *    between the original and duplicate contexts.
	 * 
	 * 4. Debuff Application Chains:
	 *    When a damage effect successfully applies a debuff, it may trigger additional gameplay effects (like
	 *    visual effects or sound cues) that reference the original damage context. All these derived contexts
	 *    can share the same DamageType tag, ensuring consistency across the effect chain while minimizing
	 *    memory overhead.
	 * 
	 * The shared ownership model is ideal for tags that may be referenced by multiple systems simultaneously,
	 * providing efficient memory usage without risking premature deletion or dangling references.

/**
 * Template specialization that defines type traits for FFoxGameplayEffectContext.
 * 
*  * WHAT THIS MEANS:
 * 1. "Template Specialization": Think of 'TStructOpsTypeTraits' as a generic "Rules Manual" for 
 *    how Unreal handles structs. By adding '<FFoxGameplayEffectContext>', we are creating a 
 *    SPECIAL version of that manual specifically for our struct.
 * 
 * 2. "Type Traits": These are "features" or "abilities" we are telling the engine our struct has.
 *    Instead of the engine guessing how to copy or send our struct over the network, these 
 *    traits act as a "spec sheet" that explicitly tells the engine: "Hey, we have a custom 
 *    NetSerialize and a custom Duplicate function—please use them!"
 * 
 * Without this "manual," Unreal would treat our struct like a simple block of data (a POD), 
 * ignoring our custom logic and potentially crashing or losing data during replication.
 * 
 * This struct tells Unreal Engine how to handle FFoxGameplayEffectContext during various operations like
 * serialization and copying. It inherits from TStructOpsTypeTraitsBase2 which provides default implementations
 * for common struct operations.
 * 
 * The enum flags control specific behaviors:
 * 
 * - WithNetSerializer = true:
 *   Indicates that FFoxGameplayEffectContext has a custom NetSerialize() function for network replication.
 *   When true, Unreal will call our overridden NetSerialize() method (defined in FoxAbilityTypes.cpp) instead
 *   of using the default property-based serialization. This is necessary because we have custom boolean flags
 *   (bIsBlockedHit and bIsCriticalHit) that need special handling during network replication to minimize
 *   bandwidth by using bit packing.
 * 
 * - WithCopy = true:
 *   Indicates that FFoxGameplayEffectContext has a custom copy implementation via the Duplicate() function.
 *   When true, Unreal will use our overridden Duplicate() method for creating copies of this context instead
 *   of performing a simple memcpy. This is important because FFoxGameplayEffectContext contains complex members
 *   like TSharedPtr (HitResult) that require proper deep copying to avoid shared pointer issues and ensure
 *   each copy has its own independent data.
 * 
 * Without this trait struct, Unreal would not know to use our custom serialization and copy logic, which could
 * lead to incorrect network replication and shallow copies that share data between contexts.
 */
/**
 * THE 'template<>' SYNTAX: FULL TEMPLATE SPECIALIZATION
 * 
 * 1. THE PRIMARY TEMPLATE (The General Rule):
 *    In the Engine source code, Unreal defines a "Primary Template." It looks 
 *    essentially like this:
 * 
 *    template<typename T>
 *    struct TStructOpsTypeTraits
 *    {
 *        enum { WithNetSerializer = false, WithCopy = false };
 *    };
 * 
 *    This is a "generic blueprint" meant to work for any struct (T). By default, 
 *    it tells the compiler that structs are basic and do not have custom logic 
 *    for networking or copying.
 * 
 * 2. FULL SPECIALIZATION (The 'template<>'):
 *    The 'template<>' syntax tells the C++ compiler: "I am not creating a new 
 *    template. I am providing a specific, concrete implementation for a 
 *    previously declared template."
 * 
 *    - Why are the brackets empty? 
 *      In the Primary Template (template<typename T>), 'T' is a variable 
 *      waiting to be filled. In this block, we have already "filled in" that 
 *      variable by providing <FFoxGameplayEffectContext> in the struct name. 
 *      Since there are no more template variables left to define for this 
 *      specific version, the parameter list is empty: <>.
 * 
 * 3. COMPILER DISPATCH (How the Engine uses this):
 *    When the Unreal Engine compiles its networking or serialization code, 
 *    it "asks" the compiler: "What are the traits for FFoxGameplayEffectContext?"
 * 
 *    The compiler sees two options:
 *    A) The generic "Primary Template" (The "General Rule").
 *    B) This "Full Specialization" (The "Specific Exception").
 * 
 *    According to C++ language rules, the compiler must always choose the 
 *    most specific version available. Because this version is explicitly 
 *    written for FFoxGameplayEffectContext, it "overrides" the generic version, 
 *    allowing our custom WithNetSerializer and WithCopy flags to take effect.
