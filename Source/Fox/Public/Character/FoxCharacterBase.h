// IAbilitySystemInterface is an Unreal Engine interface that provides a standardized way to access 
// an actor's Ability System Component (ASC). By implementing this interface, our character can work 
// with the Gameplay Ability System (GAS) and allows other systems to query for the ASC using 
// GetAbilitySystemComponent(). This is essential for GAS to function properly, as many GAS functions 
// expect actors to implement this interface to retrieve their ASC for applying gameplay effects, 
// granting abilities, and managing attributes.

// WHY GAMEPLAYABILITIES IS IN PUBLIC DEPENDENCIES (Fox.Build.cs):
// 
// We need "GameplayAbilities" in our PublicDependencyModuleNames because this header file (FoxCharacterBase.h) 
// is PUBLIC and exposes GAS types in its interface:
// - We inherit from IAbilitySystemInterface (from GameplayAbilities module)
// - We have forward declarations for UAbilitySystemComponent and UAttributeSet (both from GameplayAbilities)
// - We return these types in public methods like GetAbilitySystemComponent() and GetAttributeSet()
//
// PUBLIC vs PRIVATE DEPENDENCIES:
// - PUBLIC dependencies: Required when a module's PUBLIC headers (.h files) expose types from another module.
//   Any module that includes our public headers will transitively get access to our public dependencies.
//   Use when: Your header files use types, inherit from classes, or have members from the dependency.
//
// - PRIVATE dependencies: Required when only IMPLEMENTATION files (.cpp) use types from another module,
//   but those types are NOT exposed in any public headers.
//   Use when: You only use the dependency's types internally in .cpp files.
//
// Since FoxCharacterBase.h exposes IAbilitySystemInterface, UAbilitySystemComponent, and UAttributeSet 
// in its public interface, any code that includes this header needs access to GameplayAbilities types.
// Therefore, GameplayAbilities MUST be a public dependency.
//
// Compare this to GameplayTags and GameplayTasks in our PrivateDependencyModuleNames - we only use those 
// in .cpp implementation files, never exposing their types in our public headers.
