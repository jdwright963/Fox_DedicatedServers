	/**
	 * AddToXP_Implementation - Implementation of the IPlayerInterface::AddToXP function
	 * 
	 * This function serves as a middleman between the Ability System (AttributeSet) and the PlayerState.
	 * When the player gains XP (e.g., from killing an enemy), the AttributeSet calls this function through
	 * the IPlayerInterface interface. This implementation then forwards the XP gain to the PlayerState (by calling a 
	 * different function, PlayerState->AddToXP()), which handles the actual XP accumulation, level-up logic, and UI updates.
	 * 
	 * WHY THIS MIDDLEMAN PATTERN?
	 * - Avoids circular dependency between PlayerState and AttributeSet
	 * - PlayerState owns AttributeSet (needs to include AttributeSet.h)
	 * - AttributeSet needs to communicate XP changes back to PlayerState
	 * - Direct communication would require AttributeSet to include PlayerState.h (circular dependency)
	 * - Interface breaks the cycle: PlayerState -> AttributeSet -> Interface -> Character -> PlayerState
	 * 
	 * FLOW:
	 * 1. Enemy dies and grants XP
	 * 2. AttributeSet detects XP attribute change
	 * 3. AttributeSet calls AddToXP() on the character (through IPlayerInterface)
	 * 4. This function (AddToXP_Implementation) receives the call
	 * 5. This function forwards the XP to PlayerState->AddToXP() (a different AddToXP() function)
	 * 6. PlayerState handles XP accumulation, level-up checks, and broadcasts updates
	 * 
	 * Note: This is the C++ implementation of a BlueprintNativeEvent. Blueprint can override this,
	 * but if not overridden, this C++ version executes.

	 * - PlayerController owns the magic circle actor instance

	 * WHY DELEGATE TO PLAYERCONTROLLER?

	/**
	 * InitAbilityActorInfo - Initialize Ability System Component actor information
	 * 
	 * This function initializes the Ability System Component (ASC) by setting up the connection
	 * between the ASC, the owner actor (the PlayerState), and the avatar actor (this character).
	 * It is called from both PossessedBy() on the server and OnRep_PlayerState() on the client
	 * to ensure proper initialization in multiplayer environments.
	 * 
	 * WHY INITIALIZE ON BOTH SERVER AND CLIENT?
	 * 
	 * In Unreal Engine's client-server architecture, each machine (server and clients) runs its own
	 * instance of the game simulation. The Gameplay Ability System needs to function on both:
	 * 
	 * SERVER INITIALIZATION (via PossessedBy):
	 * - The server is the authority and makes all gameplay decisions (ability activation, damage calculation, etc.)
	 * - When a controller possesses a character, PossessedBy() is called ONLY on the server
	 * - We initialize the ASC here so the server can immediately begin processing ability logic
	 * - The server needs the ASC initialized to grant abilities, apply effects, and respond to ability requests
	 * 
	 * CLIENT INITIALIZATION (via OnRep_PlayerState):
	 * - Clients need their own local copy of the ASC to predict gameplay, show UI, and play cosmetic effects
	 * - When the server replicates the PlayerState to a client, OnRep_PlayerState() is called ONLY on that client
	 * - We initialize the ASC here so the client can display ability cooldowns, costs, and other UI elements
	 * - Client-side initialization enables ability prediction (starting abilities locally before server confirms)
	 * - Without client initialization, the player would see no abilities in their UI and have no visual feedback
	 * 
	 * EXAMPLE FLOW IN MULTIPLAYER:
	 * 1. Server creates character and assigns controller -> PossessedBy() called on server -> Server ASC initialized
	 * 2. Server replicates PlayerState to owning client -> OnRep_PlayerState() called on client -> Client ASC initialized
	 * 3. Both machines now have properly initialized ASCs for their respective roles
	 * 
	 * For player characters this function typically:
	 * - Retrieves the ASC from the PlayerState
	 * - Calls InitAbilityActorInfo() (the ASC function with the same name as this function) on the ASC with owner 
	 *   (PlayerState) and avatar (this character) parameters
	 * - Initializes attributes and grants default abilities
	 * 
	 * Note: The OwnerActor is the PlayerState (which owns the ASC), and the AvatarActor is this character
	 * (the physical pawn in the world). This separation allows the ASC to persist on the PlayerState even
	 * when the character is destroyed and respawned.
	 * 
	 * This override allows the player character to have its own specific initialization logic
	 * that differs from the base character class implementation.
