	/**
	 * Static Member Variable for Singleton Pattern
	 * 
	 * This static member variable holds the single instance of FFoxGameplayTags,
	 * implementing the Singleton pattern for this class.
	 * 
	 * Understanding Static Variables vs Static Functions:
	 * - Static functions (like Get() and InitializeNativeGameplayTags()) belong to the CLASS itself,
	 *   not to any particular instance, and can be called directly on the class name
	 * - Static functions do NOT require a static member variable to exist or function
	 * - Most static functions are simple utility functions that don't need any instance at all
	 * - Static functions can work with parameters, local variables, and other static members
	 * - A static variable is a variable that belongs to the class itself rather than any specific object (instance).
	 *   It is allocated in memory only once when the program starts and is shared by every instance of that class,
	 *   allowing it to maintain its value throughout the entire lifecycle of the application.
	 * 
	 * Why This Class Has a Static Variable:
	 * This particular class uses a static variable specifically to implement the Singleton pattern.
	 * The Singleton pattern ensures only ONE instance of this class exists throughout the application.
	 * - GameplayTags is the single instance, stored in static memory, created at program startup
	 * - The Get() static function provides controlled access to this single instance
	 * - This is a design choice for this class, not a requirement for static functions in general
	 * 
	 * Static Variable Declaration and Definition in C++:
	 * In C++, static member variables require both declaration AND definition:
	 * 1. Declaration (here in .h file): Tells the compiler this static member exists
	 *    Syntax: static FFoxGameplayTags GameplayTags;
	 * 
	 * 2. Definition (in .cpp file): Actually allocates memory for the variable
	 *    Syntax: FFoxGameplayTags FFoxGameplayTags::GameplayTags;
	 *    - First FFoxGameplayTags: The type of the variable
	 *    - FFoxGameplayTags::: Specifies this belongs to the FFoxGameplayTags class
	 *    - GameplayTags: The name of the static member being defined
	 * 
	 * Without the definition in the .cpp file, the linker will fail with:
	 * "undefined reference to FFoxGameplayTags::GameplayTags"
	 * 
	 * This is because the header only declares the variable exists, but doesn't reserve 
	 * actual memory for it - that's the job of the definition in the implementation file.
